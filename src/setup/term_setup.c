**	In this function we will get the current terminal attributes into two

**	(canonical-termiosmode) and ECHO (echo-mode) and apply to our current terminal
**	through `tcsetattr`, and one that we will keep as a backup to reset the
**	terminal to how it was before at the end of the program.
**	The non-canonical mode will make the `read` function non-blocking, so every
**	key will be returned immediately without waiting for a new line like by
**	default.
**	And the echo mode just means that when you press a key it will echo it on
**	the terminal, so disabling it will just send the key to the program without
**	echoing it, so we will have to print it manually with `write`, this will
**	allow us to move our cursor and insert/delete characters in the middle of
**	our input.
